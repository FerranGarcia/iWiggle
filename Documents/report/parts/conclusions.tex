In general terms, the simple requirements of the project involve a hidden complexity in terms of performance and the quote 'keep it simple, no overthinking' would be a must in this case.

Specifically, the solution presented based on Raspberry Pi fulfill all requirements with a moderate degree of robustness. the lighting conditions and the decrease of the camera resolution in order to boost the performance, make the segmentation a difficult task. We can conclude that using the same approach in a more powerful board would fulfill all requirements satisfactorily.

We have experienced that working in a team composed of people with diverse set of skills and backgrounds enrich the experience and improves the final result. Regarding to this last point, the design of a modular solution to the problem it has been successful and has proved to be easily adaptable to different platforms.

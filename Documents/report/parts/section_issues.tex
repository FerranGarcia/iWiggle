\subsection{Limitations}

The hardware of the Raspberry Pi doesn't allow to perform any intensive
computations, so it is necessary to balance between robustness and
computational time.

\subsection{Hardware}

\begin{itemize}
  	\item The overall performance of the Raspberry Pi showed satisfactory
  	results for the given problem.
  	\item The reliability of the WiFi connection is low - the board can lose
  connection to WiFi dongle at any time. Loss of the connection can also be caused by an
external disturbance (e.g. sharp velocity changes).
	\item RPi Camera Module is very sensitive to static electricity.
	\item Sharp increase of the torque in the motors can cause the voltage drop in
	the power supply that will lead to board shutdown
\end{itemize}

Power plug issues (?)

\subsection{Software}

\begin{itemize}
  \item OpenCV takes almost 9 hours to compile. (Include OpenCV compilation
  guide?)
  \item No Software is available for the GPU access
\end{itemize}

It was necessary to synchronize the software development for the board between
the group participants, so the development process was done using Microsoft
Visual Studio 2013. This lead to the necessity of making the code
cross-compilable. Remote access to RPi is established via SSH and an xServer.
Remote Desktop Environment was provided by MobaXTerm software.

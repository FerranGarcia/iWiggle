Three basic signs detected by the system are shown on figure below.

(color images of signs taken by camera)

These signs need to be detected and classified by the camera In order to detect

\subsection{Thresholding}

HSV chosen intuitively

YCrCb proved better

IR camera and LED improved result? (should comparison go here?)

\subsection{Classification of the signs using statistical moments}

Basics about statistical moments

Images of all three signs with drawn moments and numerical explanation of distinction between those three

\subsection{Neural network classifier}

Justification of usage neural networks.

Very brief theoretical background.

Description of the way how we train it on images (raw pixel values, segmentation pixels, hu-moments as inputs, etc)

Description of tested recognition method (sliding window, random, ...)

Performance comparison with previous method.

\subsection{Arrow angle calculation}

Description of the initial way (using moments) and failing scenarios. 

Idea of using line fitting, with slight theoretical background and results.

\subsection{Solving partial occlusion and re-detection}

Explanation of problem of partial occlusion and re-detection, when does it happen and why we want to handle it.

Explanation of perceptive area and proximity area.
